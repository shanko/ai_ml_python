### Agentic Systems
The five types of agentic AI systems are basic responders, router patterns, tool calling, multi-agent patterns, and autonomous patterns: 
1. Basic responder
This is the simplest level where the AI agent acts as a generic responder, taking a user's input and providing a direct output.
The entire flow is guided by a human. 
2. Router pattern
In this stage, the AI can make basic decisions to choose among pre-defined paths or functions.
A human is still responsible for defining the different paths and functions available to the AI. 
3. Tool calling
The AI is given a set of tools it can access and decides when to use them and what arguments to use for execution.
The agent calls external tools or APIs to complete a task, such as querying a database or running code. 
4. Multi-agent pattern 
This level involves multiple agents collaborating to complete a complex task.
Different agents might handle specific sub-tasks, and the pattern orchestrates their interactions. 
5. Autonomous pattern
This is the most advanced level, where the AI operates fully independently.
It can generate and execute code to solve problems, make decisions, and manage projects end-to-end with limited human oversight. 

### Agents
There are 5 main types of AI agents: simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents and learning agents.
